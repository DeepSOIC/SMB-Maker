SMB Maker is a small raster graphics editor program, like MS Paint.

It is written on obsolete, but refusing to go programming language - Visual Basic 6. So, it is Windows-only.

It was written by Victor Titov (DeepSOIC) just for fun, and is not intended to replace any existing graphics editor. Yet it has some interesting features. I will be glad if someone finds this project interesting.

Currently, the project is almost abandoned.

Here is a quick list of some notable features:
* Unusual autoscrolling when drawing, that allows to draw on a canvas that extends far beyond the screen without problems. You just keep dragging your mouse as if the monitor was infinite.
* A tool to quickly turn a rectangular feature on a photo distorted by perspectuve into a right rectnagle on the screen. Useful for digitizing plots from paper.
* Some effects and tools have texture mode, treating the picture as periodic.
* TopoR PCB (.fst) file renderer (outdated a bit)
* Matrix-based mixing of R/G/B components (can do manual white balancing, swap channels, change vibrance of colors). Matrix-based blending of two pictures.
* Softening and sharpening using custom colorful masks
* colorful transparency support (poor, but not the usual alpha transparency)
